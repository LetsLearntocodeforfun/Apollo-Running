## Why Apollo

Most running apps fall into two camps: simple trackers that tell you what you already know, or complex platforms buried behind paywalls and subscription tiers.

Apollo is different. It combines the depth of a professional coaching platform with the simplicity of a personal training log — and it runs entirely on your machine. No subscriptions. No data harvesting. No internet required after your initial Strava sync.

What sets Apollo apart:

- **Plans from the coaches who wrote the book** — Hal Higdon, Hanson's, Pfitzinger, Nike Run Club, and FIRST. Or build your own from scratch.
- **Intelligence that earns its name** — Race predictions refined across your entire training block. Adaptive recommendations that detect overtraining before you feel it. Pacing analysis that holds you accountable to the 80/20 rule.
- **Every run tells a richer story** — Route maps rendered as Art Deco artwork. Split-level pacing breakdowns. Effort recognition that remembers every time you've run that neighborhood loop and tells you exactly how today compared.
- **Your data, your device** — localStorage + IndexedDB. Automatic backups with SHA-256 integrity verification. Export everything as JSON. Nothing leaves your machine.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LetsLearntocodeforfun/Apollo-Running.git
cd Apollo-Running
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. Apollo's guided onboarding will walk you through choosing a plan, setting your start date, picking your preferred units, and configuring coaching preferences.

## Guided Onboarding

On first launch, Apollo walks you through a seven-step setup:

1. **Choose your path** — browse plans, get a recommendation, or build from scratch
2. **Get recommended** *(if selected)* — enter your weekly mileage and running days; Apollo scores and ranks the top three plans with reasons
3. **Browse all plans** *(if selected)* — expandable week-by-week previews with total and long-run mileage
4. **Build custom** *(if selected)* — set name, weeks (10–30), running days (3–6), current and peak mileage; Apollo generates a progressive plan with cutback weeks and taper
5. **Set your start date** — Apollo calculates the full schedule through race day
6. **Pick your units** — miles (🇺🇸) or kilometers (🌍)
7. **Configure coaching** — daily recaps and weekly readiness scheduling

You're running in under two minutes.

## Built-In Marathon Plans

Eight proven plans from the coaches who defined the discipline.

| Plan | Author | Days/Week | Peak (~mi/wk) | Philosophy |
|------|--------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Novice 1 | Hal Higdon | 4 + cross | ~45 | The most popular first-marathon plan in the world |
| Novice 2 | Hal Higdon | 4 + cross | ~48 | One step up — slightly more volume, same structure |
| Intermediate 1 | Hal Higdon | 5 + cross | ~50 | For runners with a solid base who want more |
| Advanced 1 | Hal Higdon | 5 + cross | ~57 | PR-focused with dedicated speedwork sessions |
| Beginner | Hanson's | 6 | ~55 | Cumulative fatigue philosophy — long run capped at 16 mi |
| 18/55 | Pete Pfitzinger | 5 | ~55 | Performance-focused with marathon-pace workouts |
| Marathon Plan | Nike Run Club | 5 | ~52 | Modern digital-first design with guided speed sessions |
| Run Less, Run Faster | FIRST | 3 + 2 cross | ~40 | Three quality runs per week (tempo, intervals, long) |

**Custom Plan Builder** generates progressive plans with cutback weeks every 4th week (86% volume), a two-week taper (72% then 45%), and varied workout types (easy, long, tempo, speed, cross training). Mileage builds from your current weekly volume to your target peak.

---

## Smart Auto-Sync

Connect Strava once and Apollo handles the rest.

**How it works:**
1. Apollo fetches your last 14 days of Strava activities
2. Each run is matched to a plan day by date (if multiple runs on the same day, the longest one is used)
3. Matched workouts are auto-completed
4. For each match, Apollo generates **coaching feedback** — distance analysis against the target, pace commentary tailored to the workout type (easy, tempo, speed, long), and weekly mileage status

**After every sync, Apollo also:**
- Captures heart rate data for zone analysis and efficiency tracking
- Processes route effort recognitions (repeated route detection + tier ranking)
- Updates race predictions with the latest data
- Recalculates training adherence and weekly readiness
- Generates daily recap and adaptive recommendations if due

All of this happens automatically when you open the Dashboard or Training page.

---

## Route Maps

Every synced run is rendered as a pure SVG route visualization. No Leaflet. No Mapbox. No API keys. Works fully offline.

- **Polyline decoding** — Strava's encoded polyline is decoded into coordinates
- **Equirectangular projection** with latitude correction — coordinates mapped to SVG points
- **Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification** — long routes stay performant
- **Animated route drawing** — the path "draws itself" on first render
- **Start (S) and Finish (F) markers** with glow rings; **loop detection** shown automatically
- **Mile markers** numbered along the path
- **Compass badge** showing route bearing direction
- **Three sizes** — thumbnail (activity lists), card (expanded panels), detail (full view)
- **Hover tooltips** — distance at any point along the route
- **Art Deco styling** — gold gradients, grid pattern background, corner accents, three color modes (Apollo gold, teal, Strava orange)
- **Offline caching** — up to 200 routes cached locally with LRU eviction

Visible throughout the app: Activities, Dashboard, Training Calendar, and the expanded detail panels.

---

## Route Effort Recognition

Run the same route twice and Apollo starts building your performance history.

**How routes are matched:**
Routes are fingerprinted by start/end proximity (300m tolerance), centroid distance (500m), and total distance (±20%). This is deliberately tolerant of GPS drift — if you run the same neighborhood loop but start from a different corner, Apollo still recognizes it.

**What you earn:**
- 🥇 **Gold** — your course record (fastest pace)
- 🥈 **Silver** — second fastest
- 🥉 **Bronze** — third fastest
- Separate tiers for **HR efficiency** (pace-to-heart-rate ratio) — recognizes when you run the same pace at lower cardiac cost

**What you learn:**
Apollo generates contextual insights based on real data, not generic encouragement:

> *"Your pace was 7:42/mi — 4.2% faster than your last effort on this route."*
>
> *"Heart rate averaged 148 bpm — 13% lower than last time. Your cardiovascular fitness is improving."*
>
> *"Improved efficiency — 7:42/mi at 148 bpm vs 8:03/mi at 170 bpm last time."*
>
> *"Cadence was 174 spm — 14 spm higher than your route average."*
>
> *"Strong improvement — faster pace with lower heart rate."*

Effort history builds automatically during every auto-sync. Up to 100 route bundles, 50 efforts each — stored locally, always available.

---

## Split & Lap Analysis

Every activity with split data gets a detailed pacing breakdown.

**Pace bar chart** — a pure SVG visualization showing pace per split with color-coded bars (fastest, slowest, faster/slower than mean, near mean). Includes a mean pace reference line and optional HR overlay dots.

**Consistency grading:**
- 🥇 Gold — CV < 4% (metronomic pacing)
- 🥈 Silver — CV 4–7% (strong consistency)
- 🥉 Bronze — CV 7–12% (moderate variation)
- 🔩 Iron — CV ≥ 12% (significant variation)

**Pattern detection:** negative split, positive split, even, fade (slowing in final quarter), surge, variable.

**Interval recognition:** detects alternating fast/slow lap patterns with work × rest count and ratio — so tempo runs and speed sessions are analyzed differently from steady-state efforts.

**Coaching insights** with sentiment coloring — pacing consistency commentary, split pattern analysis, HR drift detection, and progression observations.

---

## Race Prediction Engine

Apollo blends three established models to predict your race times:

| Model | Weight | Method |
|-------|--------|--------|
| VDOT | 50% | Jack Daniels' VO2max-equivalent tables |
| Riegel | 30% | Pete Riegel's time-distance formula (exponent 1.06) |
| Pace Extrapolation | 20% | Direct pace projection from recent training |

**Predictions for:** Marathon · Half Marathon · 10K · 5K

**Confidence score** (0–100) based on:
- Number of synced runs (more data = higher confidence)
- Weeks of plan completed
- Availability of heart rate data
- HR efficiency bonus: 2% time improvement when training shows strong pace at low cardiac cost

**Trend tracking:** improving, stable, or declining — so you can see whether your predicted marathon time is moving in the right direction week over week.

---

## Coaching Intelligence

### Daily Training Recaps

After each training day, Apollo grades your effort and delivers a focused coach message.

**Grades:** Outstanding · Strong · Solid · Missed · Rest Day

Each recap includes actual distance vs planned (with ± percentage), pace, duration, HR zone, and a workout-specific message. If you ran an easy day at threshold pace, Apollo will flag it. If you crushed a long run, Apollo acknowledges it. Up to 365 days of recap history.

### Weekly Race Day Readiness

A composite 0–100 score with a letter grade (A+ through D), built from five weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Volume | 25% | Weekly mileage vs plan target |
| Consistency | 25% | Run frequency and gap analysis |
| Long Run | 20% | Longest run completion and distance |
| Intensity | 15% | Workout type distribution |
| Recovery | 15% | Rest day compliance and easy run pacing |

Includes: auto-generated strengths and areas to improve, actionable tips for the following week, trend vs previous week, and a days-until-race countdown.

### Adaptive Training Recommendations

Apollo monitors five training scenarios and surfaces recommendations when action is needed:

| Scenario | Example Recommendation |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Ahead of schedule** | Suggest a 10% mileage increase or maintain current pace |
| **Behind schedule** | Reduce mileage 20% for two weeks, or add a recovery week at 50% |
| **Overtraining / fatigue** | Full recovery week (30% reduction) or moderate pullback (15%) |
| **Inconsistent execution** | Pacing education — easy runs too fast, hard runs too slow, gray zone warnings |
| **Race week** | Taper advice, estimated race pace, and race-day strategy |

All plan modifications are **reversible** — Apollo snapshots the original plan before making changes, and every recommendation includes an undo option. Safety guardrails prevent mileage increases above 10% and lock taper in the final week.

Configurable in Settings: frequency (daily / weekly / before key workouts) and aggressiveness (conservative / balanced / aggressive).

### Heart Rate Zone Analysis

Standard five-zone model:

| Zone | Name | Effort |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Recovery | Very easy conversational pace |
| 2 | Aerobic | Comfortable pace — the engine builder |
| 3 | Tempo | Comfortably hard — lactate threshold development |
| 4 | Threshold | Hard — sustainable for ~30 minutes |
| 5 | VO2 Max | Very hard — peak oxygen uptake training |

**Zone distribution chart** (last 30 days) with 80/20 rule guidance — most training should be in Zones 1–2. **HR trend chart** showing daily averages. **Aerobic efficiency tracking** (pace-to-HR ratio over time). Auto-detects and updates max HR when Strava reports a higher value.

---

## Data Safety & Backups

Your training data is important. Apollo protects it at multiple levels.

- **Dual persistence:** every write goes to both localStorage (instant, synchronous) and IndexedDB (durable, async). If either is cleared, the other restores it automatically on next launch.
- **Automatic backups** — configurable interval (12 hours to 1 week), retention count (how many backups to keep), runs silently on app startup
- **SHA-256 integrity checksums** — every backup is verified on creation and on restore. Tampered backups are flagged immediately.
- **One-click export** — download everything as a single JSON file
- **Safe import** — file size limits (10 MB), per-key size limits (1 MB), key allowlist validation, checksum verification, and a safety backup created before any restore
- **Backup health monitoring** — Settings shows a status badge (Protected / Warning / At Risk) based on backup age and integrity
- **Backup history** — every backup listed with date, size, key count, trigger type (auto/manual), and integrity status

---

## Integrations

### Strava

Full OAuth2 integration for both platforms:

| Platform | Method |
|----------|--------|
| **Desktop (Electron)** | Enter Client ID + Client Secret in Settings → OAuth redirect to `127.0.0.1` |
| **Web** | One-click OAuth via Azure Functions token exchange |

Apollo fetches: activities, heart rate (average + max), cadence, elevation, suffer score, GPS polylines, split data (metric + standard), and lap data.

**Setup (desktop):**
1. Create an app at [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Set Authorization Callback Domain to `127.0.0.1`
3. In Apollo Settings, enter your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Click **Connect Strava**

**Setup (web):** see [Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps](#deploy-to-azure-static-web-apps).

**Rate limiting:** Apollo tracks Strava's rate limits via response headers and maintains a buffer below the 15-minute and daily caps. Token refresh is mutex-protected to prevent concurrent refresh races.

### Garmin *(scaffolded)*

Client ID and Secret fields are ready in Settings. The integration infrastructure (Activity, Health, Training, and Courses API endpoints) is stubbed and designed to build on the same patterns as the Strava integration.

## Your Training Playbook

A guide to getting the most out of Apollo across your training block.

### Week 1 — Getting Started

1. **Launch Apollo** and complete the onboarding — choose a plan, set your start date, pick units, configure coaching
2. **Connect Strava** in Settings
3. **Run your first planned workout** and record it on Strava as usual
4. **Open Apollo** — your run syncs automatically, your day is marked complete, and you receive your first coaching feedback

### Every Run Day

1. Check the **Training Calendar** for today's workout
2. Run and record on Strava (GPS + heart rate for the richest insights)
3. Open Apollo — auto-sync fires on the Dashboard. You'll see your route map, coaching feedback, and (once you have repeat routes) effort recognition

### Every Week

- Review **Weekly Readiness** on the Insights page — identify strengths and areas to improve
- Check your **race prediction** trend — is your projected time getting faster?
- Look at **HR zone distribution** — are you following the 80/20 rule?
- If Apollo surfaces an **adaptive recommendation**, review the reasoning and accept or dismiss

### Building Toward Race Day

- **Run your regular routes often** — effort history builds with every repeat, and you'll start earning Gold/Silver/Bronze tiers
- **Monitor adherence** — above 85% correlates with stronger race outcomes
- **Watch your readiness grade climb** week by week as consistency compounds
- **Trust the taper** — Apollo adjusts recommendations in race week and will tell you when to ease off
- **On race day**, check your predicted marathon time on the Insights page — it's been refined across your entire training block
